                    Here at Blogs for Dogs, we strive to build a friendly and inviting space for all dog lovers. We built this platform to allow anyone with or without a canine to come share their dog's adventures or view others. As there are millions of people in the world that have an undying love for dogs, we wanted to bring everyone together on that one idea.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Not only just that, but we also wanted to create a space for verified veterinarians and trusted institutions to spread more information on our beloved dogs. The ability to share health information or advice easily to owners is important to help maintain a dog's health. With this, we created the ability to contact these verified veterinarians and/or trusted institutions directly to give our users a more one-on-one experience.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We appreciate anyone that gives our platform even the smallest look and loves dogs just as much as we do! For that, we give you the biggest thank you and please enjoy what everyone has to share!
